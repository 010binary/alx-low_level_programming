# Search Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in the C
programming language. Below is a brief explanation of each algorithm covered in
this repository:

## 1. Linear Search
Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each
element in a list until the desired element is found or the entire list has
been searched.

## 2. Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. It
works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target
element is found.

## 3. Jump Search
Jump search is a searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It jumps
ahead by fixed steps and then performs linear search in the subarray thus
formed.

## 4. Interpolation Search
Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search for uniformly
distributed datasets. It calculates the probable position of the target element
based on the value distribution.

## 5. Exponential Search
Exponential search involves two steps: first, finding the range where the
target element might be present, and then applying binary search within that
range.

## 6. Advanced Binary Search
This section covers advanced variations of the binary search algorithm, such as
recursive binary search, iterative binary search, and binary search with custom
comparators.

## 7. Jump Search in a Singly Linked List
Jump search adapted for singly linked lists, utilizing pointers to traverse the
list efficiently.

## 8. Linear Search in a Skip List
Linear search implementation tailored for skip lists, a data structure that
allows for faster searching by skipping elements using multiple linked lists
with different skip lengths.
